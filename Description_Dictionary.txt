{"Mean": "Mean is the averge or the centre of a data set of numeric data values. To find the mean or average add all the values together then divide that by the number of values. The formula is: x = ∑x/n", 
"Median": "Median is the middle number of an ordered set of data. It divides the set into two equal halves, this means that 50 of the values are less than the median and 50% are greater than it. To find the median of a data set, first order the values and count the number of values. Then if the data set has an even number of values divide it by 2, if it is uneven add 1 to the total then divide by 2.", 
"Mode":"Mode is the most frequently occuring value in a data set. To find mode, simply find the value that appears the most in a data set.",
"Variance": "Variance is the measure of average squared deviation from the central value. The sample variance formula is: s^2 = ∑(xi - x)^2 / n - 1. The (xi - x) is the deviation of each value from the mean; in other words, each value minus mean.",
"Standard_Deviation":"Standard Deviation is the square root of Variance. The sample formula for standard deviation is: s = √variance",
"Scatter":"A scatter plot shows data points of two numeric variables on an x-y graph. It shows the relationship between the two variables in terms of strength (how close the points are), its shape (linear or curved), its direction (positive or negative), and any outliers (extreme values). The x-values (plotted along the x-axis) are known as the independant variable, the influencing variable. While the y-values (plotted along the y-axis) are the dependant variable, it is the influenced variable",
"Line":"A line graph is a graphical representation of changes that occur over a given period of time. The x-axis is where the time period is plotted, while the y-axis is where the measured variable is plotted. It helps with analysing the trend of whether the variable is increasing or decreasing over time.",
"Histogram":"A histogram is a display of a numeric frequency distribution. Where data is grouped into number ranges (along the x-axis) and each range corresponds to a vertical bar (y-axis) that represents the amount of data in a specific range.",
"Bar":"A bar graph shows data with rectangular bars with the heights being proportional or equal to the values they represent. The x-axis is usually where the bars are placed, while the y-axis is show the range of the data."}
